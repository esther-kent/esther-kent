### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love Product Management and helping agile teams grow and build great products.
I am a strong believer in product management being and the juncture between engineering, UX design, and the user.
It is not enough to build great software - it has to solve a user need or else the effort is wasted.

I am interested in technologies such as Cloud Native technologies, including Kubernetes and containerization, for building reliable systems.
I have worked on multiple mission critical systems where detection and monitoring are critical to success.
I am also interested in big data and leveraging that data with AI technologies to deliver great user experiences.
